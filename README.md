# Step-by-Step Memory Allocation Project for Operating Systems in C

# Abstract 
This project implements memory allocation algorithms—First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit—in C programming. The user interacts with the program to input the number and sizes of memory blocks and processes. The algorithms allocate processes to memory blocks based on their sizes, aiming to optimize memory utilization. A notable feature is the display of the allocation process at each step, providing a detailed view of how processes are assigned to blocks. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit, offering a user-friendly interface for exploring different allocation strategies and understanding their impact on memory utilization. Overall, this project serves as an educational tool for studying memory allocation algorithms and their practical implications.
